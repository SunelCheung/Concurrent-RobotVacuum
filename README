This is a standard Java project, you can consult the source code at src/Main.java, or run the program at out/production/RobotVacuum/Main.class.
If you want to check the room status, you can modify the "showRoomStatus" parameter passed in the "simulation.start" method.
And there are two sets of config named cleanConfig and collisionConfig, entering the folder and copy robots.txt and room.txt to parent directory can switch between them.
